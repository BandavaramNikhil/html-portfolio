<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Nikhil Bandavaram. I’ve completed my B.Tech in Electronics and Communication Engineering from 
  Guru Nanak Institutions, and before that, I also completed a diploma in the same field — so I have a strong 
  foundation in electronics.</p>

 <p>Along with my academics, I’ve always been passionate about the arts. I’ve received recognition from different
   organizations for my artwork, and I really enjoy expressing creativity through it.</p>

   <p>Apart from that, I also run a YouTube channel where I teach ECE-related topics in a simple and engaging way.
     It’s something I enjoy doing because it helps me stay connected with my core subject and improves my 
     communication and teaching skills.</p>
